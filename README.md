# attention-weighted-sentiment
Upgrading static Word2Vec embeddings with a custom Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism in PyTorch. This project solves the "polysemy-blindness" of traditional models by dynamically weighting word importance based on surrounding context, significantly improving accuracy over standard mean-pooling methods.
